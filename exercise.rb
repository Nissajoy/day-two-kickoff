require 'pry'


#create a method called clean_full_name that accepts two parameters: first_name, last_name
#this method should make all the letters of both those paramters lowercase and then capitalize the first letter of each
#this method should print to the screen a combination of the first and last name as one string

#ask the user for their first name

# store it in a variable called "user_first_name"

#ask the user for their last name

# store it in a variable called "user_last_name"

#run the function
